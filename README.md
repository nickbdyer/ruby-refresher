#Ruby Refresher Challenge 

Week 7 at Makers Academy

This weekend challenge was a refresher after a couple of weeks of Javascript.
The week following this will be on Rails, hence the ruby methods will be
useful.

### Rules

* Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
* You shouldn't need any extra libraries or gems
* The cleaner your code the better!
* Googling is fine as usual
* You should be able to answer most questions with a couple of lines of code, and just a few methods. If you're writing a long, complex solution, there's probably a better way.

###Running the Test Suite

```sh

$ rspec

```
